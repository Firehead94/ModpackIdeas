- Start off as a researcher heading to the south pole. On your way there, you encounter a terrible snow storm and your plane crashes.
- You wake up, the lone survivor, with half health and near starving. You must quickly gather an useful materials and find shelter. In the downed plane, you find a jacket, map, and some food.
- You look at the map and see that you aren't too far from an abandoned research station, you should be able to reach there before succombing to the cold. 
- Upon reaching the research station, you notice it is in quite bad shape but should make for a decent shelter in the mean time.
- You get inside and find a furnace with a couple logs left to burn as well as a few matches. Once starting up the furnace, you have established a temporary base camp.
- Now that camp has been set up, a few new objectives come up. The objectives include collecting fuel for the furnace, food, and jackets for warmth.
- Fuel can be found around the base and near the basecamp in what looks to be a service tunnel.
- Food can be found by killing animals outside and growing food in the underground greenhouse.
- Clothing can be make from cotton plants, flax plants, and animal fur. Better clothing allows you to stay outside longer.
- After some gathering and hunting and what not, you get an objective to repair the radio. For this you need to find some tin and copper. Best thing to do to get them is to either go back to the service tunnel and dismantel broken machines and what not or find a pick and go mining.
- After getting the radio up, you get a message telling you to gather your stuff and head to the nearest functioning base once the storm lets up.
- Once reaching the research station, you are greated by a few scientists who give you some proper gear and food. They explain what they are doing at the station and as for your assitence.
- You are given some objectives to gather some materials and craft some machines.
- After getting the new section of the base up and running, you are then asked to expand the base by setting up a machining factory.
- The factory quest line basically is crafting and placing machines. The machines needed is basic automated ore processing and power.
- once that quest line is completed, you have to option to continue to expand that base and move to the next base. 

- After doing the rest of the quest lines at the next 2 bases, you are finally able to reach the original destination camp. 
- There you meet with some individuals who were suppose to introduce you to the area in the first place. You do a ton of end game quest lines at the final base.
- Once the end game questline is completed, you are given some materials and can start your own research base. You talk to the head researcher of the final base and he sets uo transportation to the new area.
- The new area opens up new progression quests and challenges.
